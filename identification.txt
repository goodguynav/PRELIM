a.) Explain in your own words the term "single-threaded"

//** Single-threaded for me is a machine processing where a certain program runs in a single path of execution. Meaning the
program only run single task at a time.

b.) In your own words, what is "event driven architecture"

//** For me, event driven architecture is a function or program designed as to how each task is configured, when each task
is changed by recording changes that occurs each and everytime a programmer commits.

c.) What are the benefits of a javascript module

//** The benefits of a javascript module for me is that when a new programmer like us students makes a new program then
an object is unidentified, the javascript module exports a certain objects that could fit in our program. We can also
reuse those objects given by the javascript module as a required object in other programs.

d.) Give two implementations of javascript module

//**

e.) In your own words, what is a module bundler.

//** For me module bundler is a kind of function or app that converts your modules or compresses your modules into one or more
so that when a certain browser or something won't read your modules, module bundler converts it for you.

3.) Programming

//** Programming for me is a fun but complicated kind of work. It is fun because it's like you are making something for the
internet. It's like everytime you program, you also contribute in the industry.Complicated because in order to achieve
something in programming, you need to be a logical thinker. You need to understand how everything works. You need to
understand how softwares work, how hardwares work, how the internet works.
